# Styleguide for Sketch

This styleguide is based on the bootstrap-framework.

I recommend the following plugins to support the design experience. Spend a minute to get to know these plugins:

1. Basealign – For vertically aligning text: https://github.com/abynim/BaseAlign
2. Content Generator Sketch Plugin – To automatically generate content: https://github.com/timuric/Content-generator-sketch-plugin
3. Modulizer – To dynamically adjust paddings: https://github.com/Falkeyn/Modulizer
4. Renameit – To dynamically rename multiple layers: https://github.com/rodi01/RenameIt
5. Sketch Sort Layers – To dynamically sort content based on properties: https://github.com/getflourish/Sketch-Sort-Layers
6. Sketchdistributor – To dynamically distribute content horizontally or vertically: https://github.com/PEZ/SketchDistributor

If you have any comments or ideas for improvement, open an issue.
